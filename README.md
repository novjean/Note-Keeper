Welcome to Note Keeper - the coolest note-keeping app this side of the digital divide! Keep your thoughts organized, your tasks on track, and your creativity flowing with this sleek Android application built using Kotlin.

Features 🚀
Navigation Nirvana: Cruise through your notes effortlessly with our smooth navigation powered by Nav Host Fragment. Say goodbye to getting lost in a sea of screens!

Room for Your Thoughts: We've got plenty of room for all your notes, thanks to our Room database integration. With DAO implementations and a repository for data handling, your notes are in safe hands.

Mind-blowing MVVM Architecture: Keepin' Notes doesn't just keep your notes tidy; it's got style and structure, too! We've implemented ViewModel and ViewModelFactory for that sweet MVVM architecture.

Efficiency Overload: Say goodbye to sluggishness! With RecyclerView DiffUtil, we're all about optimizing efficiency so you can spend less time waiting and more time creating.

Grid Goals: Your notes deserve to be showcased in style! That's why we've gone for a staggered grid layout to make your notes pop.
